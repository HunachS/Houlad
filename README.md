🏗️ Houlad — Scratch Mini Game

Houlad is a minigame created on Scratch, where the player controls falling houses. The goal of the game is to carefully place the houses on top of each other. It is a simple but visually pleasing mechanism that trains attention, coordination and timing.


🎮 Gameplay

The player presses the button to start the game (SecondaryDisplay).

The first house appears on the screen in position.

A random house starts falling from above.

The player can control it with the left/right arrows.

When a house touches the previous one, it disappears, and a new one takes its position.

The cycle repeats.
